<p>In Short: We collect personal information that you provide to us.</p>

<p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

<p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more about this in our Cookie Notice: https://xinyue.me/cookies.</p>

<p>The information we collect includes:<br>

&#61607; Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.<br>
&#61607; Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.<br>

2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

<p>In Short: We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</p>

<p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:<br>

<p>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

<p>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>

<p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:<br>
&#61607; Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.<br>
&#61607; Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.<br>
&#61607; Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>

<p>&#61607; Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.<br>
If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>

<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:<br>
&#61607; If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way<br>
&#61607; For investigations and fraud detection and prevention<br>
&#61607; For business transactions provided certain conditions are met<br>
&#61607; If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim<br>
&#61607; For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin<br>
&#61607; If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse<br>
&#61607; If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province<br>
&#61607; If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records<br>
&#61607; If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced<br>
&#61607; If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes<br>
&#61607; If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</p>

<p>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>

<p>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>

<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:<br>
&#61607; Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>

<p>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>

<p>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>

<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>

<p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>

<p>
To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a &quot;sale&quot;/&quot;sharing&quot; (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section &quot;DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?&quot;</p>

<p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice: https://xinyue.me/cookies.</p>

<p>
Google Analytics</p>

<p>
We may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyze the use of the Services. The Google Analytics Advertising Features that we may use include: Google Analytics Demographics and Interests Reporting. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across the Services, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. You can opt out of Google Analytics Advertising Features through Ads Settings and Ad Settings for mobile apps. Other opt out means include http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ and http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy &amp; Terms page.</p>

<p>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

<p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

<p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

<p>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>

<p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to minors.</p>

<p>Minors' Privacy and Safety We are deeply committed to protecting the privacy and safety of minors. Our website is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 without parental or guardian supervision. If you are a minor, you must obtain permission from your parent or legal guardian before interacting with any content or features on this site. In accordance with relevant laws and regulations, we do not knowingly collect personal information from minors without appropriate consent. Any data provided by minors, whether through interaction with the website or submission of content, will be handled with the utmost care and confidentiality. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected information from a minor without appropriate consent, we will take steps to delete that data as quickly as possible. For parents and guardians, we encourage you to monitor your child&rsquo;s online activities and to guide them on safe internet usage. Should you have any concerns or questions about the information collected from minors, please contact us immediately.</p>

<p>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

<p>In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>

<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.</p>

<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.<br>
 <br>
If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>

<p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>

<p>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.</p>

<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

<p>Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. For further information, please see our Cookie Notice: https://xinyue.me/cookies.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at xinyue@xinyue.me.</p>

<p>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

<p>
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
