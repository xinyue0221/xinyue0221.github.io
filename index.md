<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I'm Xinyue Wang, a student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) [Online High School](https://ohs.stanford.edu/) with a deep interest in Gender Studies, Human Sexuality, and Math. Driven by a passion for understanding complex societal dynamics and identities, I integrate mathematical precision in analyzing these nuanced subjects. My aim is to contribute to impactful research that fosters inclusivity and awareness. Beyond academics, I actively engage in community outreach and education, aspiring to inspire and empower through knowledge. My journey is marked by intellectual curiosity and a commitment to societal betterment.

My research lies at the intersection of **gender studies** and **human psychology** -- with a special focus on utilizing mathematical theories and methods to analyze patterns and data related to gender, human sexuality and BDSM interests. My research interests include **quantitative analysis in gender studies**, **societal impact studies**, **gender roles**, **media perception**, and **number theory**.

    I am currently on the 2023-2024 academic job market, looking for faculty positions in CS, CSE, ECE, IEOR, etc., related to Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research in related seminars.
