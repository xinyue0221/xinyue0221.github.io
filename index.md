I'm Xinyue Wang, a student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) [OHS](https://ohs.stanford.edu/) with a deep interest in Gender Studies, Human Sexuality, and Math. Driven by a passion for understanding complex societal dynamics and identities, I integrate mathematical precision in analyzing these nuanced subjects. My aim is to contribute to impactful research that fosters inclusivity and awareness. Beyond academics, I actively engage in community outreach and education, aspiring to inspire and empower through knowledge. My journey is marked by intellectual curiosity and a commitment to societal betterment.

My research lies at the intersection of **gender studies** and **human psychology** -- with a special focus on utilizing mathematical theories and methods to analyze patterns and data related to gender, human sexuality and BDSM interests. My research interests include **quantitative analysis in gender studies**, **societal impact studies**, **gender roles**, **media perception**, and **number theory**.
