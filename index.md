<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I'm Xinyue Wang, a student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) [OHS](https://ohs.stanford.edu/) fascinated by the intersection of Chemistry and Mathematics. Working under Dr. Nick DeMello, I dive into quantum organic chemistry research, where I'm developing novel pH indicators and reimagining collegiate level general and organic chemistry labs for the digital age. When I'm not exploring molecular mysteries, I apply mathematical frameworks to understand gender dynamics and human sexuality.

My research bridges **quantum chemistry** and **computational methods** -- currently focused on creating innovative pH indicators and virtual lab experiences that make chemistry more accessible. I also explore **gender studies** through a mathematical lens, uncovering patterns in social dynamics. My work spans **computational chemistry**, **organic chemistry**, **quantum modeling**, **digital education**, and **quantitative social / emotional analysis**.

Beyond the lab, Iâ€™m also a student activist and published op-ed writer, using my voice to speak out on justice, education, and youth civic engagement. Check out my **[pieces](https://xinyue.me/opinions)**!
