<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I'm Xinyue Wang, a student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) [OHS](https://ohs.stanford.edu/) fascinated by the intersection of Chemistry and Mathematics. Working under Dr. Nick DeMello, I dive into quantum organic chemistry research, where I'm developing novel pH indicators and reimagining collegiate level general and organic chemistry labs for the digital age. When I'm not exploring molecular mysteries, I apply mathematical frameworks to understand gender dynamics and human sexuality. Beyond the lab, you'll find me sharing my passion for science through community outreach, believing that great discoveries should be accessible to all.

My research bridges **quantum chemistry** and **computational methods** -- currently focused on creating innovative pH indicators and virtual lab experiences that make chemistry more accessible. I also explore **gender studies** through a mathematical lens, uncovering patterns in social dynamics. My work spans **computational chemistry**, **organic chemistry**, **quantum modeling**, **digital education**, and **quantitative social / emotional analysis**.
