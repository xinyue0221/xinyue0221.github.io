        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I’m Xinyue Wang, a sophomore at Stanford University OHS with a deep interest in Gender Studies, Human Sexuality, and Math. Driven by a passion for understanding complex societal dynamics and identities, I integrate mathematical precision in analyzing these nuanced subjects. My aim is to contribute to impactful research that fosters inclusivity and awareness. Beyond academics, I actively engage in community outreach and education, aspiring to inspire and empower through knowledge.</p>
        <p>My research lies at the intersection of gender studies and human psychology – with a special focus on utilizing mathematical theories and methods to analyze patterns and data related to gender, human sexuality, and sadomasochistic interests. My research interests include quantitative analysis in gender studies, societal impact studies, gender roles, and media perception.</p>

        <h3>About the Course</h3>
        <p>Single Variable Calculus develops four major math concepts: limits, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. These four powerful ideas allow us to extend the use of equations to looking at how they behave.</p>

        <p>During the first semester of the course, students will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Study, calculate, and utilize limits to examine a function’s behavior, including end behavior and behavior at discontinuities.</li>
            <li>Define the derivative and interpret its meaning in context.</li>
            <li>Learn procedures for finding derivatives efficiently.</li>
            <li>Apply derivatives in various situations.</li>
            <li>Model real-world situations with basic first order differential equations and acquire various techniques for solving such equations.</li>
            <li>Explore the history of the development of Calculus.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Throughout the course, we will look at functions through four perspectives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analytical</strong> - using symbols, equations, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphical</strong> - using the visual representations of graphs.</li>
            <li><strong>Numerical</strong> - finding solutions or sets of solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Verbal</strong> - describing functions precisely using proper mathematical language.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Students will be expected to be facile in all four of these perspectives.</p>

        <h3>Textbook</h3>
        <p>The main texts for the course are OpenStax Calculus, Volumes 1 and 2, which you can get it online at no cost.</p>
